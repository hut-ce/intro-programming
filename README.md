* The samples directory is contains all of sample cores for subjects.

## How to complete Lab course as good student

[1] Clone repository to own account.

[2] Don't upload your codes in public domain, use github private project or university gitlab server

[3] Update cloned branch for new assignments template

* Add the remote, call it "upstream":
```bash 
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/hut-ce/intro-programming
    git fetch upstream
    git checkout main
    git rebase upstream/main
```

[4] Create new branch for assignments (`git branch pr-main`)

[5] commit your codes in branch (`git add pr-main & git commit`)

[6] set branch remote to private repository like CEIT Gitlab (`git push -u https://git.hut.ir/aut.ac.ir/XYZ pr-main`)

[7] after passing the course, add your id and semester in last line of *who-know-cpp-course.md file by pull request.

## Teaching Assistants and Lab Instructors over Semesters

Dear TA, Lab instructor, you can add your name and semester in [who-had-cpp-ta.md](./who-had-cpp-ta.md) file by pull request or create new issue.
